/**
 * Q - WE HAVE TO ROTATE A SQUARE MATRIX IN 90 DEGREE
 * Ans - Steps have to follow :--
 *      STEP 1 - Declare a Square Matrix
 *      STEP 2 - Observe what happen when we rotate it to 90 degree clockwise
 *      STEP 3 - We observed if we rotate a square matrix into 90 degree clockwise, then it's first row 
 * interchange the last column, then second row interchange last second column
 *      STEP 4 - So we have to use two loops to make it interchange
 *      STEP 5 - One loop starts first row and second loop starts with last column to interchange.
